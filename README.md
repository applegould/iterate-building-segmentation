# iterate-building-segmentation
Segmenting images in a folder for building extraction using Meta's Segment Anything Model. The code in this repository was originally written and run in Google Colab using the T4 GPU runtime (using Colab Pro).

This code was created for GEOG 387 - New Methods in Earth Observation Fall 2023 (Clark University) by Apple Gould-Schultz with support from Andrew Niehaus under Dr. Lyndon Estes. This is a combination of work completed by Meta and Weixuan Du (Clark University). For more details, please email agouldschultz@clarku.edu with the subject line "Iterate Image Repo" + any other relevant details.
